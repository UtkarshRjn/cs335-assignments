def Q2_kernel_1(a,b):
    '''
    Look at the diagram from the question part 1 & 
    write an appropriate kernel which returns a scalar value 
    determining the relation of input in higher dimension space
    Input to everyone will be common
    Output will be graded based on accuracy of the classfier learnt with the help of the kernel
    Try to find generalized solutions rather than overfitting the test cases
    ALSO COMMENT THE KERNEL WHICH YOU HAVE IMPLEMENTED

        upto what dimension non linearity should be mapped
